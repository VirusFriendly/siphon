# Siphon - Remixed

Back in 2002, I took cleaned up the Siphon code and added functionality. It was
a different world back then. There was not Github or even Google Code. In order
to poke project maintainers and give them your additions to their code, you had
to find out where in the seedy underbelly of IRC they hung out at. It probably
was not EFnet, not that I would be found dead there. Also, they never responded
to any of my emails to them. So, I made this fork of their code, back before
forks were cool. Are forks cool?

The original repo of my fork can be found with the following command:

 rsync -ai a.cvs.sourceforge.net::cvsroot/lawless/ .

But this repo is really for historical purposes. If you're really keen on
passive OS detection, then you want [p0f3](https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/p0f3/).
I really wish I had worked more on this project or advertised it more. I could
have been as cool as lcamtuf. Who knew that passive OS detection would be so
cool? Let this be a lesson to you younger programmers. Self-promote and build a
community around your projects.
